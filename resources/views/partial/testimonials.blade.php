                       <p>He has a great sense of creativity and passion for his craft. Nathan was always willing to put in the time and effort to complete his projects under tight and ever-changing deadlines.  He is always up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in design and development. He exhibited great patience when it came to working with the non-technical members of our team.  He was able to communicate with them in a manner in which they could relate. </p>

                       <p>Upon his arrival at Lion, Nathan bonded with our team almost immediately and quickly became an asset and key player in the work flow of our group.  We soon discovered that Nathan is a dedicated and adept problem solver.  Many times someone in our group came to him with a problem that they were stuck on and time and time again he came up with timely, inventive solutions.  His Flash skills are top notch; having seen him work on dozens of projects, each with very specific and challenging specifications, I don’t believe that there is anything Nathan can’t accomplish with Flash. Over the time he worked under me, he became my “go-to guy” when I needed a difficult task done. </p>

                       <p>He brings to the table a formidable skill set: he is a talented designer and has worked hard to become very skilled with Flash. He was also extremely forthright in sharing his extensive knowledge with the team. Nathan is calm under fire and was very helpful in relieving the team of many projects when they were heavily burdened.  </p>
